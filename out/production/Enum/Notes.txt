Advantage of ENUM over Constant.
1)  both are use for declaring constant, but enum is type safe which means it will show error at compile time.
    helps us to make less error.

2)  we can define more than one Constant in one enum varibale, refer to this example.

Q1. Can we create the instance of Enum by the new keyword?
Ans:
No, we canâ€™t create the instance of the Enum keyword because it contains private constructors only.
Also, We can't use set method as well.

Ans:
Yes, we have an abstract method in Enum.

Q3. What is the purpose of the values() method in the enum?
Ans:
In Java, the values( ) method can be used to return all values present inside the enum.

Ans:
By using the ordinal() method, each enum constant index can be found, just like an array index.
